# MemCal
#### Video Demo: https://youtube.com
#### Description:
A simple cross-platform calculator.
This project was chosen to give me a chance to learn .NET and the MVVM model,
and as such it is built in C# using the Avalonia framework. It can theoretically
run on Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and WASM, although it has only been tested
on the three desktop environments.
